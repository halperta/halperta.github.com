<div class="blogTitle">Sahaguntine Announcement</div>
<div class ="blogContent">
  <p> A Universal History of the Things of New Spain, by the M. R. P. Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun.
  <p> In the last sessions the attention of our Academy was occupied by the important work which was left, among others, by the franciscan Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun and which is considered, with reason, to be the most complete document that is known with respect to the ancient history of Mexico, beginning with its origins and comprehensively covering all the information necessary to make known, in all of its phases, the existence of a great empire. We should be very interested in the story of its marvelous conquest. More than the glory of our  country envied that those who put their heart and hands in enterprises suggested by ambition or by ego and confirmed by fortune, for the philosopher and appreciator of true merit, it is the vicisitudes and fortune of the conquered that must be studied, not the greatness of the conqueror.
  <p> This is how our age understands it; and it is not to exaggerate the merit of our wise missionary to say that in sense he [...]; because, if in that time historical formulations were, in general, more expositive than dialectic, no one devoted himself to the point of gathering tradition and harmonizing it with facts; supporting it with true, authoritative testimony; validating it with oral references, and gathering together numerous assemblies of educated and elderly men, a kind of jury that testified to the truth of the evidence, resuscitating ancient memories, confronting their declarations, and measuring everything against the balance of observation and the most strict criteria. Furthermore, the father Sahagun wrote his history in the language of the natives; he poured it out in the common language, and illustrated his text with philological notes and glossaries, the result of which is not only precise with regard to the narration, but also complete with respect to the internal nature and external manifestations of this great civilization. We must ascertain how this illustrious monument has come to us, reuniting the parts that have been dispersed, until we have comprehensively reproduced the original work.
  <p> This, according to an authentic account, was conserved in the convent of the Franciscan friars of Tolosa, from where it was brought to the court by order of the Council, desiring to know it, and even to censor certain materials within it, considering them dangerous. It remained there for some years, during which time the convent begged for the restitution of what it saw as its property, an idea in which the Council agreed, though it presumed to keep the original and only return a copy. It is undoubtably due to this circumstance that the work was divided into fragments and passed into the hands of various owners. One of those is our Academy, which conserves as an inestimable treasure in its library an exemplar of the manuscript of the <i>Historia Universal de las cosas de la Nueva Espa\~na repartida en doce libros, en lengua mexicana y espa\~nola, hecha por el M. R. P. Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun, fraile de San Francisco de Observancia</i>. Thus the title is written, but it cannot be applied completely to our codex. Of the twelve books, it only contains four: VIII, IX, X, and XI. The three first chapters and the first paragraph of the fourth chapter of book X are organized according to the plan proposed by the author for the composition of his History, which is to say: in one column of Mexican text; in the next, its translation into Spanish; and in the third, a glossary of Mexican words; with colored pictures in the margins made by hand, doubtless by Native drawers, which represent that which is referred to in the chapters. In the chapters that follow the fourth and in the prior chapters, only the Mexican text is written in the central column of the page, and the paragraphs have epigraphs in Spanish, in the hand of father Sahagun himself.
  <p> As our codex contains only the four final books, what has happened to the earlier ones?  Fortunately, they exist in the private library of S. M., where it is easy to transcribe them. They have the same order given in the original plan, though it must be mentioned that some have been rearranged; they are all signed with the name of Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun. Many other notices, which can be deduced from a detailed study of the numerous codices, would extend our remaining time too long; they are not from this place, and must be reserved for a more formal and difinitive investigation.
  <p> Given that the Academy is interested in bringing to light the complete work of father Sahagun in the state in which we know it, it would stumble over a thousand difficulties and risk, in the end, a defective result. It is necessary to turn to our sources, acquire new information, search the archives and libraries that may not yet have been explored, or that have been explored for other purposes. There is well-founded evidence that the Laurenciana library of Florence posses a valuable exemplar, the most complete that can be found: it will be important to travel there, not to confirm whether the rumors are true, but taking them as certain, and, given this certainty, compelling our Government to open diplomatic negotiations to compel the Italians to send us the exemplar, as occurred with the <i>Cancionero de Baena</i>, which is in Paris, and as has not been done with many other books that a government solicited and obtained.
  <p>Given that in 1829 in Mexico, a translation of the Mexican text by D. Carlos Mar\'ia Bustamente was published, and in 1840 book XII, which pertains specifically to the conquest, was published; and given that Lord Kingsborough reprinted this same translation in his luxurious volumes of the <i>Antiquities of Mexico</i>; the Academy cannot be content with this sparce demonstration of its hard work, patriotism, and zeal. It is obligated to do much more: to save from obscurity our most distinguished monuments, that which illustrates a  most difficult conquest, the greatest glory that a nation can celebrate among the many epic feats that sparkle among in its annals. Concerning the material execution of the task, the very magnitude of the enterprise will not intimidate the person who proposes to complete it; the resources of the Academy are great enough to succesfully complete the task; it is of interest to the nation, and the government that represents it will be happy to find occasion to obtain the applause of locals and foreigners with such a meritorious project.

<div class="blogTitle">Extracurriculurs</div>
<div class ="blogContent">
    <p>An <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/04/11/extracurriculars-are-robbing-students-their-education-essay">article out in the Chronicle today</a> tells us that undergraduates are in an extracurricular arms race. They do too many extracurriculars, writes William Hurst, and it's destroying their education.
    <p> I was surprised to see the article because just yesterday I gave an impromptu monologue about how much I admire my undergraduate students for precisely this choice. 
    <p> My speculation: I think very few students go to college primarily to learn interesting things. Instead, they go to college to develop skills that will help them in the workplace. In this way, they are not so different from the young man at Harvard in 1840 whose correspondence I'm reading right now. He, too, saw college as one step on the road to a professional degree, and one that he did not take too seriously. He preferred the bars and dances to Latin and Greek. As a lawyer, however, his classical education would ultimately provide him with cultural capital. This is less certain in the professions that most undergraduate students, even among elite liberal arts colleges, pursue today.
    <p> My students expect to come out of college looking like employees. Classrooms are rarely able to help with that, in part because choices we make as instructors, but extracurricular activities can. Employers look for resumes full of valuable experiences, which classwork on its own cannot provide. They seek hard skills like grant writing, programming, or design, many of which are not available in the classroom. They also look for professional experience with teamwork, project management, and budgets. The same, not coincidentally, is true of the employers that most PhD students in the liberal arts will face after graduating. If classrooms, especially in the liberal arts, do not value these things, students will look elsewhere. As they should. 
    <p> It can be frustrating, as an instructor, to have students fail to complete coursework. One solution is to reorient the classroom towards professional goals. Design assignments that students can talk about in a job interview. Assess teamwork with the same criteria that might be used in a professional workplace. Align your curriculum with the professional world.
    <p> This makes some faculty uneasy, and for good reason. Perhaps the task of the liberal arts classroom is not to prepare a student for their entry level job, but rather for the job they may want in five or ten years, when a solid grounding in research, methods, and critical thinking is more highly valued. In that case, the recommendations made by Hurst may be appropriate. But the incredibly hard-working, driven, brilliant students that I know will always be forced to chose between a surplus of opportunities. And a classroom that doesn't share their priorities is not likely to win their full attention.

<div class="blogTitle">A Beginner's Guide to Presenting at MLA</div>
<div class ="blogContent">
    <p>January was both my first time attending MLA, and also my first time presenting at MLA. I came prepared to give the same kind of conference presentation I have given at ACLA, TXDHC, and GRACLS. The talk was oriented around a single argument, divided into two sub-arguments, presented visually and without reading over the course of 18 minutes. </p>
    <p>I found that the format didn't fit the forum, and so I thought I would write what I learned for those who may come after me.</p>
    <p>1. Be general: Many panels at MLA feature speakers who have been thinking about the ideas, questions, concerns, provocations that they bring to the table for decades. The content, then, tends to be broad, and the tone tends to be inquisitive. Replace the tripartite argument of a seminar paper with a query that involves only very brief, very accessible close-readings. Reduce theory to the simplest of misrepresentations. End on an up-tick that may or may not be a question. </p>
    <p>2. Be sociable:  Many panels at MLA are organized almost a year in advance, responding to conversations that have been going on for decades. If you don't know the conversation, your presentation may appear peripheral. But you can resolve this with a little research into your panel and their work. Know the panelists, anticipate their arguments, and speak directly to their claims whenever possible.</p>
    <p>3. Be short: no more than fifteen minutes. Everyone is tired. </p>
    <p>4. Don't wear jeans: I wore (very nice) jeans (with a blazer) on my firt day at MLA and two strangers, both male tenured faculty, commented separately on the choice. It's a battle that's not worth fighting.
