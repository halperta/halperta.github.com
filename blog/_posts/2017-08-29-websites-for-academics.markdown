I spend a lot of time trying to convince grad students that they need a web presence.

Why? There are a lot of reasons, but the one I find most compelling is that I use scholars’ websites all the time.

When I meet interesting people at conferences, I google them. When I want to learn more about a speaker’s work, I look them up online. Websites facilitate access to personal information, like your work or your contact info.

Anyway, recently a student responded positively to my encouragement. She wanted to build a website that would be free and simple to create and update, and asked me for resources.

I had trouble finding up-to-date information about how to build an academic website. So I did some research on Twitter. Responses are below, with thanks to [@eveewing](https://twitter.com/eveewing), [@lgauth19](https://twitter.com/lgauth19), [@ixcicoatl](https://twitter.com/ixcicoatl), and [@rctatman](https://twitter.com/rctatman):

# Make it Yourself

GitHub is a free online repository for storing code. You can also store and publish a website using GitHub, a process that is made relatively easy thanks to a useful tutorial that Amanda Visconti wrote for the Programming Historian. She writes:

This lesson is for you if you’d like an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, preservation-friendly, secure website over which you have full control, such as a scholarly blog, project website, or online portfolio.

Basically, Github Pages is a nice option because:

* Your website isn’t controlled by a corporation like WordPress or Wix.
* Your website is static, so it requires minimal data.
* You have total design control.

But, GitHub isn’t for everyone, because:

* You have to use markdown to edit content, and markup (like html) to change the style.
* It can take quite a bit of time to get started, depending on what you know going in. (Amanda Visconti says no tech background is required, but I’m skeptical.)

My website was made using Jekyll and GitHub! I love it.

# Use an Online Template

@LGauth19 and @icxicoatl recommended using online templates like WordPress and Wix. Both are free, easy-to-use services for building websites. You create a log-in linked to your email address, and then you can choose from templates, customize the look and feel of the site, and edit content in a standard text editor (so no html required).

WordPress and Wix are nice because:

* Very low learning curve.
* Easy-to-use interface.
* Pre-made templates.

But, they’re not for everyone because:

* You have to pay for extra features, like certain kinds of templates or editorial options.
* You are subject to the whims and changes of the companies.
* Unless you pay extra, you’ll have branding (WordPress or Wix) on your website.

The Humanities Commons has useful information for creating a WordPress site. (Scroll to the bottom of the page).

# Use a University Platform

@eveewing suggests using pre-existing platforms designed specifically for academics. Some universities will host websites for scholars (including graduate students) using a platform like Open Scholar, a drupal platform used by universities like Harvard.

University websites are good because:

* They come with institutional branding.
* They are free and usually easy to set up.

But they’re not for everyone because:

* You’ll have to transfer or rebuild your site if you move to a new institution.
* You’ll have to get a new domain name if you move to a new institution.
* Your control of the look may be limited.

# Use an Academic Commons

Academic commons are websites that you can use to build a professional profile by aggregating publications. Arxiv and Google Scholar could both be thought of in this way. But in the humanities, we more often use academia.edu and the Humanities Commons.

Academia.edu is [a bit controversial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/01/23/dear-scholars-delete-your-account-at-academia-edu/), but it’s an easy way to create an online identity, connect with other scholars, and make your publications available. You can also upload your CV, but the look of your profile is standardized and you can’t do other things, like host a blog. There are further features if you are willing to pay.

[The Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/) is a non-profit site intended to substitute for academia.edu. It similarly allows scholars to create profiles and connect with others scholars, and serves as a respository for material like publications.

Because these sites are designed to be used by those who have memberships, they’re not exactly public websites. So it’s smart to link your academia.edu or Humanities Commons account to a public facing website.

# Get A Domain Name

Whatever option you choose, @eveewing recommends you purchase a domain name. This allows you to have a unique URL that belongs to you, that won’t change as you move institutions, and that doesn’t reveal who you partnered with to build your site.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
