 #GenerousThinking was a Twitter hashtag project inspired by Kathleen Fitzpatrick's book "Generous Thinking: A Radical Approach to Saving the University." Throughout January of 2020, participants used the hashtag a part of a daily practice of generosity, asking what it looks like to build compassion into the work of higher ed.

 The project began in January of 2020 and lasted for about a month, but the hashtag continues to be used.
