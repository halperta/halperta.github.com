*Higher Calling* is a project for everyone who decided to become a scholar because they believed in the mission of higher education. "Finding Your Purpose" is a workbook to help all of us navigate the contradictions between the work we are driven to do and the conditions we face in our working lives.

"Finding Your Purpose" offers guided questions, exercises, and rituals to help you orient yourself in relation to your work; trace your lineage; identify your community; embrace sources of pleasure; articulate your values; and find your purpose.

The Finding Your Purpose workbook will be made available for free as an eBook and downloadable pdf on June 17, 2022. A small number of copies will also be printed on a risograph gr3770 by Shalperta Press.
