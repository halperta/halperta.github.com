<p style="text-align: center;">I am a program specialist in the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities, where I work to make DH funding more accessible and impactful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My own DH practice involves both redesigning technologies or using them in unfamiliar ways to correct for the violence that colonialism, neoliberalism, and capitalism have had on our relationship to information, history, and each other.</p>
