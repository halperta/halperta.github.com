<p style="text-align: center;">As a researcher, I study how cultural heritage institutions have used text technologies like lithography, photostats, and optical character recognition to shape how we read history. I am particularly interested in how these technologies are used to replicate and intervene in the violence caused by national, colonial, and imperial relationships. In my digital humanities work, I seek to put these theoretical questions into practice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">More recently, I have become interested in the 'pivot to digital' brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is reshaping humanities practice and education.</p>
