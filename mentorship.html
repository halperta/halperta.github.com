  <p class="intro"> &nbsp; 
    I provide support to humanists thinking about their careers in three ways. I conduct informational interviews with students and contingent workers. I provide mentorship to students. And I occasionally speak on career panels at conferences or universities. This page provides information on how and when to get in touch with me for any of these kinds of support.

  </p>

  <h1><p class="sectionTitle">Informational Interviews</a></h1>

      <p class="publine">
        Are you a student or contingent worker interested in speaking with me about my career trajectory or current work? I am happy to schedule a 45 minute conversation about digital humanities careers, leaving academia, and working at a funding agency.
      </p>
      
      <br>

      <p class="publine">
        Email me to schedule a conversation. Some things you might include in your email: a little bit about yourself (where you work/study, what you're interested in, etc.) and what it is about my work that particularly interests you.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p class="publine">
        If you're not sure how to conduct an informational interview, check out this great resource from the Job Market Support Network: <a href="https://hcommons.org/docs/informational-interviewing-for-phds/">Informational Interviewing for PhDs by Dr. Susan Martin, University of Maryland</a>. 
        <br><br>
        Once we've spoken, I consider you part of my professional network, and would be happy to hear updates on your career search or to answer any additional questions that come to mind, to the best of my ability. Please note that an informational interview does not mean I'll be able to help you get a job at my agency, or anywhere else for that matter. I also can't promise that I will immediately recognize you if we meet again --- I am truly awful at names and faces. Please don't take it personally!
      </p>

  <h1><p class="sectionTitle">Students and Interns</a></h1>

      <p class="publine">
        Have you worked with me as a student or intern? If I have taught a class you were in or supervised you as an intern, I consider it part of my job to do the following: have regular conversations about your studies and career, provide feedback on your job materials, and write letters of recommendation. 
      </p>
      
      <br>

      <p class="publine">
        If you want a letter of recommendation or for me to serve as a reference, please provide the following: a copy of your resume/cv and cover letter, a copy of the job description, and a brief description of anything you would particularly like me to cover when speaking with the search committee. If you were my student, please note that I may not be the best person to write a letter: status matters, and faculty on the tenure track matter more. If you were my intern at the NEH, I am happy to speak in my capacity as an NEH staff member, which carries a little more weight. For letters, please give me at least two weeks notice.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="publine">
        If you are a student who I have worked with in any capacity and just want to talk about career stuff, don't be afraid to reach out! I am always glad to think through career possibilities with you, and if I know what you're looking for, I'll be better able to connect you with colleagues or pass on things that may be of interest. Send me an email with a brief description of what's going on in your professional life and we can find a time to talk. 
      </p>


    <h1><p class="sectionTitle">Public speaking</a></h1>

      <p class="publine">
        I am occasionally able to speak publicly about my career trajectory on panels or at campuses. If you are a university employee who would like me to speak on your campus, please read <a href="https://halperta.medium.com/so-you-want-to-invite-an-alt-ac-to-speak-on-your-campus-a46da71366d0">this article on inviting alt-acs to campus</a>. In your request, please do provide information about how my presentation will be part of a more comprehensive initiative to improve career experiences for grad students. Please also note that I am a white cis woman and I prefer not to take part in all-white panels or speaker series.
        <br><br>
        If you are a graduate student creating your own bottom-up career initiative in the absence of institutional support, don't hesitate to reach out! If I'm not able to participate, I'd be glad to share resources and help connect you with others who might be. As above, please make sure to include some info about what kinds of support your institution is providing... or not. 
      </p>
