<h2 id='general'>General</h2>

<p>Your purpose in this 5-7 page (1500-2100 word) essay is to write an article for a publication of your choice that advocates a position related to your controversy. You can choose any written medium, including a blog, an online magazine, a corporate journal, or a newspaper. In the first part of the essay, you will write an opinion article (approx. 1000-1500 words) in which you advocate for a particular position in your controversy. In the second part of the essay (500 to 1100 words), you will analyze your own rhetorical strategies, writing to convince me that you have constructed a successful and appropriate argument.</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<p>Choosing a context: In the upper left-hand corner, you must state the name and format of publication for your essay (for example: New York Times: Editorial or huffingtonpost.com: Blog).</p>

<p>Part One: Writing in the style of your chosen medium, you must construct a coherent argument in favor of a position of your choice. This argument should include at least one argument based on an ethos appeal, at least one argument based on a logos appeal, and at least one argument based on a pathos appeal. However, the most important thing is that you choose strategies that you consider effective and appropriate to your context.</p>

<p>Part Two: in the second part of your essay, you will need to analyze your own writing in order to convince me that you have constructed an effective argument. You need to explain how you demonstrate your credibility to your audience. You need to explain how much bias you chose to reveal in your writing, and why you think this is appropriate. Finally, you need to show how you are using rhetorical strategies to construct a coherent and convincing argument given the context of your publication.</p>
