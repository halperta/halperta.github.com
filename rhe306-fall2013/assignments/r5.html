<h2 id='assignment_overview'>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Write a one-page (8.5x11) paper describing and analyzing the ethos and pathos of the article you wrote about in RS5.</p>

<p>Put your name in the top left hand corner and list the author&#8217;s name and the full citation information of the piece you&#8217;re summarizing; set margins at 1 inch, spacing at single, and font at 12 pt. Do not exceed a page in length. This should be about 500 words.</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<p>This assignment asks you to consider two aspects of the text: ethos and pathos. It should have three sections.</p>

<p>In the introduction, briefly state your controversy and describe the position taken by the author.</p>

<p>In the second section, describe the &#8220;ethos&#8221; of the article by answering the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What kind of evidence does the author use <em>in the article</em> to demonstrate his or her authority to write about the controversy? (For example: The author is a scholar who studies this controversy. The author has a profession related to the controversy. The author lives in the location where the controversy is taking place. The author was personally effected by the controversy.)</li>

<li>What kind of sources does the author refer to in the article? (for example: scholarly research; newspapers; historical figures; family; colleagues)</li>

<li>To conclude this section, summarize how the author establishes her or his authority. What kind of audience is this author appealing to?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the third section, identify one place where the author makes an emotional appeal. Describe the appeal: how is it made? What emotions does it call upon? What assumptions does it make about its audience? * For example: a short story about a child suffering from an illness evokes feelings of sadness and sympathy, and assumes that the audience was family-oriented. A claim about the &#8220;government takeover of america&#8221; provokes feelings of anxiety and fear, and assumes that the audience is politically inclined to small governments. A story about a teenager&#8217;s accomplishments provokes feelings of hope and pride, and assumes that the audience believes in the &#8220;American Dream.&#8221;</p>
