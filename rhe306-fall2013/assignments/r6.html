<h2 id='assignment_overview'>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>In Essay 3, your task will be to write a position article for a magazine, journal, newspaper, or blog of your choice. For RS6, write a one-page paper analyzing the writing style of your chosen medium. Read two articles (on any subject) from the forum of your choice and describe if and how the authors establish credibility, establish bias, and use rhetorical strategies. Include the citations for your two sources, in MLA format, at the end.</p>

<p>Put your name in the top left hand corner; set margins at 1 inch, spacing at single, and font at 12 pt. List full citation information of the pieces your anaylzing at the end. Do not exceed a page in length. This should be about 500 words.</p>

<h3 id='choosing_a_medium'>Choosing a medium:</h3>

<p>You should choose a medium that you think could theoretically host an essay such as the one you plan to write. It should be a popular web or print medium that often prints opinion articles – the “opinion” section of a newspaper like the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times; the “blog” section of the Huffington Post or of Fox News; a magazine like Wired; etc.</p>

<h3 id='specifics'>Specifics</h3>

<p>This essay should have four parts, of which the fourth part is the most important.</p>

<p>In the first part, briefly describe the medium you have chosen.</p>

<p>In the second part, briefly describe how your three authors establish textual credibility. What do they say in their writing to show that they are credible? Do they use inflammatory language? Do they provide extensive sources? Do they reference relevant information?</p>

<p>In the third part, briefly describe the degree of bias that your three authors exhibit. Do they explicitly acknowledge their bias in the text by stating their stake in the situation? Do they use biased language (hyperbole, emotional keywords)? Do they reference counter-arguments?</p>

<p>In the fourth part, describe the rhetorical strategies used by these three authors. How do they construct their emotional, logical, and ethical appeals? (Do they use lists of statistics? Do they tell long emotional anecdotes?) Is their argument primarily pathos-based or logos-based?</p>
