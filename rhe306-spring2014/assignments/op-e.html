<p>Unit Three is all about improving your writing skills. <em>The only way to improve your writing skills is to write a lot.</em> These optional essay prompts are designed to get you thinking about writing.</p>

<p>RS6 (Prompt 1): Choose a blog that you find interesting (try The Huffington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Wired, Scientific American, Psychology Today, Buzzfeed, or one of your choice.) Write a blog post of no more than 400 words in which you take a position on something you feel strongly about. It could be anything of your choosing - if you&#8217;re stuck, feel free to write about your controversy for the class. Make sure you spend a little time reading blog posts to get a sense of the style for example. Remember to focus on energy and concision.</p>

<p>RS7 (Prompt 2): Write a 400-900 word editorial for a newspaper of your choice, taking a position on something you feel strongly about. It could be anything of your choosing - if you&#8217;re stuck, feel free to write about your controversy for the class. Make sure you spend a little time reading sample editorials to get a sense of the style.</p>

<p>RS8 (Prompt 3): Write a 400-900 word rebuttal to your essay three. Take the opposite position that you were planning to take for essay three, and write for the same forum (newspaper, magazine, etc.) that you are planning to write for on essay three.</p>
