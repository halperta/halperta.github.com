<h2 id='assignment_overview'>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>For essay 2, you will be asked to analyze the persuasive strategies of a single text that takes a position on your controversy. For this assignment, your task is to write a 350-450 word paper in which you analyze how the author of your chosen text establishes his or her authority and uses it as a persuasive device.</p>

<p>Note that for our purposes, a &#8220;text&#8221; can be loosely defined as any persuasive effort that can be interpreted. A &#8220;text&#8221; may be a print article (such as an opinion column in a newspaper). It may also be a blog entry, a video, a commercial, an image, or a web-page. You should select a text that makes a clear argument&#8211;a text that very clearly asks the audience to believe, feel, or do something.</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<p>This research summary must include three sections:</p>

<p>In the first paragraph of your summary, briefly introduce your controversy and chosen source. Explain where the source was published. Introduce the author.</p>

<p>In the second paragraph of the essay, explain the context of the source. Where and when was it published? What event or text is it responding to? What is its purpose?</p>

<p>In the third part of your summary (1-3 paragraphs), chose two or three specific examples of ethical appeals: places in the text where the author establishes his or her authority over the text. These might be images, texts, citations, descriptions of the author&#8217;s family or achievements, etc. For each example, make sure that you introduce the example, describe the example, and then analyze by explaining: how that example establishes authority, what kind of authority is being established, and who that authority might appeal to.</p>

<p>In your conclusion, sum up your analysis by evaluating the examples. Does the author effectively estabish authority? Is the authority appropriate for the audience? Is it appropriate for the debate?</p>
