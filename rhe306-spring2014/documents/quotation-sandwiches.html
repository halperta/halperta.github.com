        <h1>Quotation Sandwiches</h1>
        <!--<ol class="toc"></ol>-->
        <p>This is a strategy for thinking about the integration of evidence into a paragraph. The basic idea is that your writing functions as a sandwich in which your evidence is the meat, and your introduction and analysis act as bread. For an essay such as essays 1.1 and 2.1, you should <em>always</em> have both &#8220;meat&#8221; and &#8220;bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<p>The top of the quotation sandwich makes a claim:</p>

<pre><code>In his article “Your Massively Open Offline College is Broken,” Clay Shirky argues that MOOCs are important because the current system isn’t working. </code></pre>

<p>The middle of the sandwich presents the evidence that illustrates/supports this claim.</p>

<pre><code>As he puts it, “School is broken and everyone knows it” (1). The problem, he writes, is the cost of higher education: public college fees went up 72 percent in the last decade, while the market value of a bachelor’s degree decreased by 15 percent (1). </code></pre>

<p>The bottom of the sandwich interprets the evidence and explains how it supports the claim.</p>

<pre><code>In this context, a four-year education is not a viable option for most students, and the kind of education provided by traditional institutions does not meet the needs of the students attending them.</code></pre>

<p>Now make a transition to another quotation sandwich.</p>

<pre><code>For Shirky MOOCs, which are free and student-directed, resolve this problem....</code></pre>
