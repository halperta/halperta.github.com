<h2 id='general'>General</h2>

<p>Scientific studies produce specific and clear results, but popular culture uses those results to produce wildly varied interpretations, and to persuade their audience of a multitude of different positions. Your purpose in this 4-6 page essay (1200-1800 words) is to compare two articles that take different positions regarding a single aspect of vaccination use. Your goal is to understand what persuasive strategies the authors use to make their point. Your thesis should address the question: <em>how are the persuasive strategies in these two articles similar or different, and why?</em> Your essay should then answer this question by providing a close analysis of the two articles.</p>

<h2 id='specifics'>Specifics</h2>

<h3 id='choosing_articles'>Choosing articles</h3>

<p>You must choose two articles related to a single aspect of the vaccination debate. This could be MMR and Autism, but it could also be the development of an ebola vaccination, the obligatary chickenpox vaccine; etc. To be effective for this essay, your articles must take different positions on a single controversy. They should also both have at least one reference in common; in other words, they might both provide evidence from the same scientific study, or refer to the same new policy, or speech, or law. Finally, they should both be published in the past year.</p>

<h3 id='conducting_the_analysis'>Conducting the analysis</h3>

<p>Before you begin writing, you are advised to conduct a rhetorical analysis using the following worksheets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='../documents/scienceWorksheet.docx'>Science Worksheet</a></li>

<li><a href='../documents/pathosWorksheet.docx'>Pathos Worksheet</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After you have conducted a thorough analysis, you will want to work through the comparison. What is similar about the rhetorical strategies? What is different?</p>

<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll want to develop a working thesis. Remember your thesis must be an argument that is worth arguing about. Why are the two articles using different strategies? What does that tell you about the nature of the controversy? About the audience?</p>

<h3 id='writing_the_essay'>Writing the essay</h3>

<p>Your essay should begin with a strong introduction and thesis.</p>

<p>You should contextualize the articles by introducing the controversy and describing the position, author, publication context, and audience for the two articles. You will want to make sure that this description serves to support your thesis.</p>

<p>You should then look closely at three or more rhetorical aspects of the articles. You might focus, for example, on: style, emotional language, anecdotes, rhetorical figures (like metaphors, etc.), facts, citations, etc. For each aspect that you choose to analyze, first describe how it is used in the two texts. Then, analyze the effect of this use. Finally, offer a hypothesis about how and why the authors use different (or similar) strategies.</p>

<p>In your conclusion, you should summarize your analysis to explain <em>how</em> the text tries to persuade its audience and <em>why</em> it uses those strategies. In this section, you may offer an evaluation: do you consider these strategies effective? Why or why not?</p>

<h2 id='evalution'>Evalution</h2>

<p>Your essay will be evaluated on the following criteria (10 points each)</p>

<ul>
<li>Thesis: is your thesis clear, analytic, and appropriate?</li>

<li>Context: do you provide specific context? Do you use the context of the articles to support your thesis?</li>

<li>Analysis: Did you select effective examples for analysis? Does your analysis provide insight into the persuasive strategies of the text? Does it support your thesis?</li>

<li>Structure: Is the overall structure of your argument effective and clear? Are the paragraphs clearly structured?</li>

<li>Writing: Do you write in an appropriate style, using consistent grammar, spelling, and punctuation?</li>
</ul>
